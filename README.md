## How to use this for your own token service

To use this passport you need to do the following: 

- Fill in the variables inside the index page and rebundle
- Handle the callback on your server

The passport service will allow you to authenticate on the client side and ensure they have the tokens and once sent over you just need to handle the callbacks.
